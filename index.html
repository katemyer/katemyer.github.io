        <p class="subbullet">“Imagination is the foundation of all invention and innovation.” – J.K. Rowling</p>

        <p class="bullet">Kate (she/her) has a Ph.D. in Developmental Health Psychology from the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, where she pursued her passion in examining the relationship between health behaviors, morality, and affect by applying advanced statistical models resulting in several peer reviewed publications. Her interests in programming piqued during the life cycle of her dissertation when she saw creating simple snippets of code using SAS and MPLUS combined with technology could make data collection and analysis significantly more efficient. Kate excels in understanding front-end user expectations with her background in the study of human behaviors. She is driven to fulfill her curiosities in how technology could be integrated to improve customer experience and overall sense of well-being. Her envisioned goal with her acquired fullstack developer skills from ADA Developers Academy is to produce useful applications and align with a company whose mission is to improve the well-being of the community at large. In her spare time, she aspires to make the perfect cup of coffee, propagate succulents, run races, and knit beanies her children will never wear.</p>
