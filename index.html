        <p class="subparagraph">Kate (she/her) has a Ph.D. in Developmental Health Psychology from the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, where she pursued her passion in examining the relationship between health behaviors, morality, and affect by applying advanced statistical models resulting in several peer reviewed publications. Her interests in programming piqued during the life cycle of her dissertation when she saw creating simple snippets of code using SAS and MPLUS combined with technology could make data collection and analysis significantly more efficient.</p>
            
        <p class="subparagraph">Kate excels in understanding front-end user expectations with her background in the study of human behaviors.
