  <ul>
    <li>I believe that knowing self defense is an important aspect and right for everyone- to protect one's self and our loved ones. In receiving certification, I co-instruct in monthly classes teaching women defense against knives, guns, and ground attacks.</li>

</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Natural beauty became important when I garnered an understanding of how products were tested on animals. I want to leave a better world for my children and the first step was to become more conscientious about everyday products. This led me to start a personal website exploring the best of what the natural beauty community had to offer. As a result, I collaborated with several brands and gathered a community of 2500 women connected over social media.</li>
  </ul>
