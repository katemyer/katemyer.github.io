    <h2 class="subtitle">Women's Self Defense Certification</h2>

    <div class="images">
        <img src="./images/wsd.png" alt="wsd" width="400" height="400">
    </div>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>I believe that knowing self defense is an important aspect and right for everyone- to protect one's self and our loved ones. In receiving certification, I co-instruct in monthly classes teaching women defense against knives, guns, and ground
                attacks.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <h2 class="subtitle">Green Beauty</h2>

    <div class="images">
        <img src="./images/greenbeauty.png" alt="greenbeauty" width="400" height="400">
    </div>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Natural beauty became important when I garnered an understanding of how products were tested on animals. I want to leave a better world for my children and the first step was to become more conscientious about everyday products. This led me
                to start a personal website exploring the best of what the natural beauty community had to offer. As a result, I collaborated with several brands and gathered a community of 2500 women connected over social media.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Running</h2>

    <div class="images">
        <img src="./images/charityrun.png" alt="running" width="400" height="400">
    </div>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Nothing is better than running for a charitable cause alongside a good friend. It has been an honor to complete races benefiting breast cancer and heart health research and building homes in the Philippines.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Knitting</h2>

    <div class="images">

    </div>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Knitting is therapeutic and challenging in the most gratifying way. I love finding that most people find knitted gifts something to be treasured and appreciated.</li>
        </ul>
